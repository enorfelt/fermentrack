# Fermentrack and ESP8266-based Controllers

Fermentrack was explicitly built to support ESP8266-based controllers regardless of connection method (WiFi or Serial). 

For more information on ESP8266-based firmware, please refer to one of the following:

* [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/enorfelt/brewpi-esp8266)
* [HomeBrewTalk Thread](https://www.homebrewtalk.com/forum/threads/native-esp8266-brewpi-firmware-wifi-brewpi-no-arduino-needed.586476/)


If connecting an ESP8266-based controller via serial, please note that by default Fermentrack will detect the USB serial number associated with your Arduino when initially configured, and will use that - instead of the specified serial port - to connect. For more information, read the "About Serial Port Autodetection" note in the ["Guided Setup" instructions](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-serial-connected-controller).


## Setting Up an ESP8266-based Controller in Fermentrack

There are two options for setting up a controller in Fermentrack - Guided Setup and Advanced (Manual) Setup.

[**Guided Setup - WiFi**](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-wifi-connected-controller) - Instructions are available [here](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-wifi-connected-controller). When choosing the board type, select "ESP8266" from the dropdown.

[**Guided Setup - Serial**](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-serial-connected-controller) - Instructions are available [here](../config/BrewPi Controller Setup.md#setting-up-a-serial-connected-controller). When choosing the board type, select "ESP8266" from the dropdown.

[**Manual Setup**](../config/Advanced Controller Setup.md) - Instructions are available [here](../config/Advanced Controller Setup.md).
